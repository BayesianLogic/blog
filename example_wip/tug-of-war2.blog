/**
 * Tug of war
 * 
 * The strength of each person is drawn from a normal distribution. 
 * A person is lazy 10% of the time. The pulling power of a person 
 * is half her strength if she is being lazy and otherwise is her 
 * full strength. The pulling power of a team is the sum of the 
 * pulling power of the individuals on the team. The team with the 
 * greater pulling power wins.
 *
 * This version uses sum of a list and list comprehension.
