--- Instructions for sample.sh on Ubuntu Machine ---

sample.sh calculates the symmetric KL divergence for every queried set of distributions of a particular BLOG example.
It estimates the true distribution of a queried variable by taking the expectation of the BLOG example ran with 
the LW Sampler over a specified number of trials.
It then computes the average symmetric KL divergence between the LW Sampler and the "true estimate", and 
the average symmetric KL divergence between the MH Sampler and the "true estimate"

1. Install GNU parallel
>>> sudo apt-get install parallel

2. checkout latest commit of fix-bug-MHSampler
>>> git checkout fix-bug-MHSampler

3. compile
>>> sbt/sbt compile

4. run script from top-level directory of blog
>>> pwd
~/blog
>>> find example -name "*.blog" | parallel -k -j 4 --eta "bash ./tools/testing/sample.sh 10000 {} 10 tools/testing/output/KL.txt {#}"

- uses 10,000 samples
- runs 10 trials
- outputs the result to tools/testing/output/KL.txt
- uses 4 processes (you can adjust with "-j" option)
- prints out information (--eta)
- this script is buggy. 
	- doesn't work for vectors (throws exception on regex matching, and even if I did get it working, the state space would be too large). 		- doesn't work on continuous random variables.
	- the KL divergence is misleading (sometimes Infinity) for discrete distributions where there values in the support with near zero probability (e.g. Poisson). 
	- the script crashes when the MH Sampler doesn't work. see "Blog Examples Status" spreadsheet for list of BLOG examples that are known to fail
