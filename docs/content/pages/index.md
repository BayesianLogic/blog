**Bayesian Logic** (BLOG) is a probabilistic modeling language. 
It is designed for representing relations and uncertainties among 
real world objects. For instance, tracking multiple targets in a 
video. BLOG makes it easy and concise to represet 
- uncertainty about the existence (and the number) of underlying objects
- uncertain relations among objects
- dependencies among relations and functions 
- observed evidence

BLOG also provides a query language to ask questions about what the world
could possibly be after making observations.  

BLOG also refers to the default inference system for models specified 
in BLOG language.
