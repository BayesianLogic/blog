I used a subset of the NYT dataset (provided by Wei Wang, not sure where he got it from) to run these experiments. Only subjects, objects, and verbs are observed. Queries are in the form of "What is the relation of each sentence?"

Results for medium dataset:

	Total number of data points: 1088
	Number of Correct Labels: 310
	Accuracy Rate: 0.2849264705882353
