Constructed an artifial dataset consisting of 20 sentences, and 5 relations:
	R[0] = Leadership
	R[1] = Teaches a Class
	R[2] = Student to Professor
	R[3] = Authorship
	R[4] = Made Money From

I constructed these such that there are a lot of overlaps between the argument pairs and the relations. The goal is to see if the current model has a bootstrap (or semi-supervised clustering like) effect on the data when the entities and triggers are represented ONLY as strings.




Experiment 1:

Purpose: To test bootstrapping.
 - 20 Sentences
 - 3 Relations
 - 5 Verbs, 2 for R[0], 2 for R[1], 1 for R[2]

  R[0] = Leadership
  R[1] = Teaches a Class
  R[2] = Student to Professor
