  Abstract                 = {As computation continues to move into the cloud, the computing platform of interest no longer re- sembles a pizza box or a refrigerator, but a warehouse full of computers. These new large datacenters are quite different from traditional hosting facilities of earlier times and cannot be viewed simply as a collection of co-located servers. Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer (WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs on a single board.},

  Abstract                 = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

  Abstract                 = {Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}) suffer from a widely recognized scalability problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability, we have developed a parallel {SVM} algorithm ({PSVM}), which reduces memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization, and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is significantly smaller than n), and m the number of machines. {PSVM} reduces the memory requirement from O(n2) to O(np=m), and improves computation time to O(np2=m). Empirical study shows {PSVM} to be effective. {PSVM} Open Source is available for download at http://code.google.com/p/psvm/.},

Since their introduction in 1993, particle filtering methods have become a very popular class of algorithms to solve these estimation problems numerically in an online manner, i.e. recursively as observations become available, and are now routinely used in fields as diverse as computer vision, econometrics, robotics and navigation. The objective of this tutorial is to provide a complete, up-to-date survey of this field as of 2008. Basic and advanced particle methods for filtering as well as smoothing are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification is an important data analysis tool that uses a model built from historical data to predict class labels for new observations. More and more applications are featuring data streams, rather than finite stored data sets, which are a challenge for traditional classification algorithms. Concept drifts and skewed distributions, two common properties of data stream applications, make the task of learning in streams difficult. The authors aim to develop a new approach to classify skewed data streams that uses an ensemble of models to match the distribution over under-samples of negatives and repeated samples of positives.},

Perhaps the most novel feature of the book is its use of Kalman filtering together with econometric and time series methodology. From a technical point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models. This technique was originally developed in control engineering but is becoming increasingly important in economics and operations research. The book is primarily concerned with modeling economic and social time series and with addressing the special problems that the treatment of such series pose.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

  Abstract                 = {A new algorithm for the prediction, filtering, and smoothing of {non-Gaussian} nonlinear state space models is shown. The algorithm is based on a Monte Carlo method in which successive prediction, filtering (and subsequently smoothing), conditional probability density functions are approximated by many of their realizations. The particular contribution of this algorithm is that it can be applied to a broad class of nonlinear {non-Gaussian} higher dimensional state space models on the provision that the dimensions of the system noise and the observation noise are relatively low. Several numerical examples are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern applications such as Internet traffic, telecommunication records, and large-scale social networks generate massive amounts of data with multiple aspects and high dimensionalities. Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently, tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional, sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker (MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over 1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before. Finally, we demonstrate a data mining case-study using MET.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a methodology to sample sequentially from a sequence of probability distributions that are defined on a common space, each distribution being known up to a normalizing constant. These probability distributions are approximated by a cloud of weighted random samples which are propagated over time by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This methodology allows us to derive simple algorithms to make parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms interact to perform global optimization and sequential Bayesian estimation and to compute ratios of normalizing constants. We illustrate these algorithms for various integration tasks arising in the context of Bayesian inference.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle methods are popular computational tools for Bayesian inference in nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models. For this class of models, we present two particle algorithms to compute the score vector and observed information matrix recursively. The first algorithm is implemented with computational complexity ?(N) and the second with complexity ?(N≤), where N is the number of particles. Although cheaper, the performance of the ?(N) method degrades quickly, as it relies on the approximation of a sequence of probability distributions whose dimension increases linearly with time. In particular, even under strong mixing assumptions, the variance of the estimates computed with the ?(N) method increases at least quadratically in time. The more expensive ?(N≤) method relies on a nonstandard particle implementation and does not suffer from this rapid degradation. It is shown how both methods can be used to perform batch and recursive parameter estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {Data stream values are often associated with multiple aspects. For example, each value from environmental sensors may have an associated type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) as well as location. Aside from timestamp, type and location are the two additional aspects. How to model such streams? How to simultaneously find patterns within and across the multiple aspects? How to do it incrementally in a streaming fashion? In this paper, all these problems are addressed through a general data model, tensor streams, and an effective algorithmic framework, window-based tensor analysis (WTA). Two variations of WTA, independent- window tensor analysis (IW) and moving-window tensor analysis (MW), are presented and evaluated extensively on real datasets. Finally, we illustrate one important application, multi-aspect correlation analysis (MACA), which uses WTA and we demonstrate its effectiveness on an environmental monitoring application.},

  Abstract                 = {How do we find patterns in author-keyword associations, evolving over time Or in data cubes (tensors), with product-branchcustomer sales information And more generally, how to summarize high-order data cubes (tensors) How to incrementally update these patterns over time Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings. However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example). We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic methods and strategies and discusses some related theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical side, results from the theory of general state space Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence rates, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain methods. These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also give guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we study trajectory planning and control in voluntary, human arm movements. When a hand is moved to a target, the central nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position. First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination. Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories. This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective function CT is defined as follows: \$\$C\_T = \frac{1}{2}{}^t\int\limits\_0^f {\sum\limits\_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{{{\text{d}}z\_i }}{{{\text{d}}t}}} \right)^2 {\text{d}}t,} } \$\$ where ziis the torque generated by the i-th actuator (muslce) out of n actuators, and tfis the movement time. Since this objective function critically depends on the complex nonlinear dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, it is very difficult to determine the unique trajectory which yields the best performance. We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations. These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torquechange criterion.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) for nonlinear time series analysis, with applications to learning models of human pose and motion from high-dimensional motion capture data. A GPDM is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dynamics, as well as a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We demonstrate the approach and compare four learning algorithms on human motion capture data, in which each pose is 50-dimensional. Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.},
