/**
 * Implements a generic MCMC proposal algorithm. Each step changes the value of
 * exactly one instantiated RV (selected uniformly at random from the
 * instantiated RVs), then samples values for previously uninstantiated RVs to
 * make the resulting instantiation self-supporting. It also uninstantiates any
 * RVs that become barren.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each variable is sampled from its prior distribution given its parents. The
 * forward proposal probability is just the probability of choosing the selected
 * variable to change, times the product of the probabilities of values sampled
 * (for that variable and any other variables that must be instantiated to make
 * the instantiation self-supporting). The backward probability is the
 * probability of choosing the same variable again, choosing its old value, and
 * re-instantiating all the newly uninstantiated variables to their old values.
 * No other moves can yield the same proposed world because each move changes
 * the value of exactly one instantiated variable (it just instantiates and
 * uninstantiates other variables).
 * 
 * <p>
 * GenericProposer does not use identifiers in the worlds it constructs.
