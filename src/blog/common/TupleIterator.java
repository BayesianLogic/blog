	 * cartesian product. In the start state, each iterator returns a single
	 * element. Afterwards, while iterator #1 has anything to return, we replace
	 * the first element of the previous tuple to obtain a new tuple. Once
	 * iterator #1 runs out of elements we replace it and advance iterator #2. We
	 * keep on advancing iterator #1 until it runs out of elements for the second
	 * time, reinitialize it again, and advance iterator #2 once more. We repeat
	 * these operations until iterator #2 runs out of elements and we start
	 * advancing iterator #3, and so on, until all iterators run out of elements.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This method of generating the m-tuples is very similar to producing all
	 * numbers of m "digits" in the order of their magnitude, where the i-th
	 * "digit" is in base<sub>i</sub> = #(i-th Collection in the cartesian
	 * product) and we assume that the "numbers" in the i-th Collection are
	 * ordered in some way.
