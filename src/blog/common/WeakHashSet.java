/**
 * A HashSet class that uses weak references to its elements. This means that if
 * the only reference to an object is from this set, the object will be
 * garbage-collected and removed from this set.
 * 
 * The current implementation is built on WeakHashMap: it's just a map where
 * every key is mapped to Boolean.TRUE. It would be a bit more elegant (and save
 * some memory) to write this class from scratch. But it can't be built on top
 * of an ordinary HashSet, because we want to store WeakReference objects while
 * using the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods of their
 * referents.
