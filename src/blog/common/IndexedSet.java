/**
 * Data structure that behaves like a set, except that its elements also have
 * consecutive indices starting at zero. Different implementations may assign
 * these indices in different ways: for example, according to the ordering on
 * elements defined by a Comparator object, or according to the order in which
 * objects were added. Indices are not guaranteed to remain stable when the
 * IndexedSet is modified. In some implementations, adding or removing elements
 * may change the indices of other elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * IndexedSet extends the Set interface with additional methods <code>get</code>
 * and <code>indexOf</code>, which behave like the corresponding methods in the
 * List interface. Also, iterators over an IndexedSet go in the order defined by
 * the indices. The only thing that invalidates an iterator is removing an
 * element without going through the iterator's <code>remove</code> method.
 * Notably, adding elements does not invalidate iterators.
 * 
 * <p>
 * One advantage of using an IndexedSet is that you can sample an element
 * uniformly at random in constant time (by getting the element at a random
 * index <i>n</i>). Another is that you can iterate over it just by incrementing
 * an integer index.
