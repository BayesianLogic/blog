/**
 * Represents the partitions of two sets of references, called the foreground
 * set and the background set. There are methods for moving a reference from one
 * set to another; the foreground and background histograms are both updated, so
 * that the total number of references referring to each object always remains
 * the same. There are also methods for getting the foreground and background
 * histograms, which implement the ReferenceHistogram interface and are backed
 * by the ReferenceHistogramPair object.
 * 
 * A ReferenceHistogramPair object does not maintain two separate histograms
 * explicitly. Instead, it starts with one master histogram representing the
 * full set of references. It represents the foreground histogram explicitly,
 * and represents the background histogram implicitly as the difference between
 * the master and foreground histograms. The point is that we don't have to
 * explicitly construct the background histogram, which may be quite large. The
 * master histogram is never changed.
