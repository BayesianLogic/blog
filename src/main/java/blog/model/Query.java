 * object records both results from a single run of an inference algorithm, and
 * statistics about the results of several runs (if the inference algorithm is
 * randomized, each run may yield different results).

 * <p>
 * The <code>getVariables</code> method returns a set of random variables such
 * that the result of this query depends only on the posterior joint
 * distribution of these variables. There are two ways in which this posterior
 * distribution can be provided to the Query object. One is to call
 * <code>updateStats</code> repeatedly, passing in partial worlds with weights;
 * these worlds must be complete enough to define values for all the query's
 * variables. The other way is to pass in a factor over these variables using
 * <code>setPosterior</code>.
