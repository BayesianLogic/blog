/**
 * A multiset is like a set, except that it can include multiple copies of an
 * element. It differs from a list in that the element occurrences are not in
 * any order. Formally, a multiset consists of a set S and a function m(x) that
 * maps each element x of S to the number of times it occurs in the multiset.
 * <p>
 * The Multiset interface extends the Collection interface, adding methods for
 * getting the number of distinct elements and the number of times a given
 * element occurs in the multiset. Its size() method returns the sum of the
 * occurrence counts of all the elements. The iterator returned by the
 * iterator() method on a multiset may return multiple copies of the same
 * element. To get an iterator over the distinct elements, use
 * distinctIterator().

	 * element e. Thus, entrySet.size() returns the number of distinct elements in

	 * The returned set supports element removal: removing an entry corresponds to
	 * deleting all occurrences of the corresponding element from the multiset.
