/**
 * A class for measuring how much time a program spends doing certain
 * operations. Each Timer object acts like a stopwatch that keeps track of an
 * elapsed time. When you call the start method, the elapsed time starts
 * increasing; when you call the stop method, it stops. Unlike a stopwatch,
 * there is no "reset" method.
 * 
 * There is also a static method printAllTimers which you can call at the end of
 * a program to get the elapsed time for every timer created during this run of
 * the program.
